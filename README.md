# Eventula Developer Meetings

This repository now houses all topic lists and protocolls of the Eventula developer Meetings.

## Usage

When a new meeting is scheduled (mostly on first tuesday all three months at 20:00 MEZ/MESZ), a new markdown file is created inside the `meetings` folder (use the template in the root folder).

This File gets filled with topics for the meeting, which can either happen via Pull request (or commit if you have access).

While the Meeting runs, we are going to take notes for each topic inside the file and commit it afterwards.
